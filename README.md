# Sand_cat_optimisation_algorithm

The modiifed SCSO offers balanced behavior in exploration and exploitation. It overcomes the original SCSO in the way that original SCSO may stuck while converging and might not reach the global optima in all cases, especially for complex problems. It uses random walk strategy enhancing the exploitation phase.
